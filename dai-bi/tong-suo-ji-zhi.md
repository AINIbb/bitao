# Deflation

At present, the deflation model adopting dividend mechanism has 6 main destruction ways, which are divided into three stages step by step.

### 1\) the black hole address will be destroyed with Cash dividends \(enabled\) <a id="uVM64"></a>

According to the rules of the contract, all the coin-holding addresses are charged, and the black hole address is also a coin-holding address. Therefore, the number of tokens that are distributed to the black hole address will be permanently thrown into the black hole address, which is equivalent to being destroyed. In addition, the dividend handling fee is allocated according to the proportion of the number of coins held. The initial number of coins held at Black hole addresses accounts for 52%. As time goes by, the proportion becomes larger and larger, and the destruction proportion becomes larger and larger.
