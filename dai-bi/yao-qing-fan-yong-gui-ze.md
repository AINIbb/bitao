# Invitation Reward Rules

According to tokenomics:

> 6% of transation between users is charged, of which 1% is used to add LP, 3% is sent to Operate Management Account, 1% is sent to the blackhole address, and 1% is distributed to holders.

> 11% of transation On Pancakeswap is charged,  of which 1% is used to add LP, 6% is sent to Operate Management Account, 2% is sent to the blackhole address, and 2% is distributed to holders.

For each transaction, if there is a referrer, 60% transation fee of distributed to holder will be sent to referrer as reward. When amount of black hole reaches 18,900 billion, that is, the remaining total amount is 2100 billion, black hole burnt stops, and transation fee ratio will be adjusted.

**Decentralized Invitation Mechanism has been written into the contract, that is, if Address A sends  more than 10M ZGoat to Address B as the first one, then Address A is the referrer of Address B permanently. Then, for each transaction of Address B, 60% transation fee of distributed to holder will be sent to Address A as reward.**

\*\*\*\*

_Example:_

Your address is A, your friend's address is B（and address B has no referrer）

If address A sends to address B ≥ 1000W ZGoat **as the first one**, address A will be the referer of address B permanently. 

Assuming address B sold out 100M ZGoat for one transation on Pancakeswap, then address A will be rewarded, the current set ratio is 60%, reward amount = 100M ZGoat \* 2% \* 60% =1.2M ZGoat.
