# Commission invitation rules

60% handling fee is charged for each transfer transaction between users, of which 1% is used to add LP,3% is used to operate accounts, 1% is transferred to the black hole address, and 1% is used to pay dividends to the holders.

10% of the handling fee is charged for each transaction on the contract, of which 1% is used to add LP,6% is used to operate accounts, 2% is transferred to the black hole address, and 1% is used to pay dividends to the holder.

For each transfer transaction or contract transaction, if the trader has a recommender, 60% of the bonus of the transaction handling fee holder will be used to reward the recommender. When the number of black hole destruction reaches 90% of the total amount, that is, 18,900 billion, the remaining total amount is 2100 billion, black hole destruction stops, and the handling fee ratio is adjusted.

**According to the rules, a decentralized Commission invitation mechanism \(which has been written into the contract\) is adopted. The first ZGoat that transfers money to an address ≥ 1000W will be accepted by the contract.**

**If the referrer is identified as the address, the referrer will permanently enjoy the 60% reward of the handling fee of the paid bonus.**

_Example:_

Your address is A, your friend's address is B, and address B has no recommender. If address A is the first to transfer money to address B ≥ 1000W ZGoat, address A will be the referer of address B forever. Then, A part of the handling fee generated for each transaction after address B will be rewarded to address A, and the current set ratio is 60% of the handling fee for holding coins and dividends.
