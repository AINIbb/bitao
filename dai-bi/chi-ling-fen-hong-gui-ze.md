# EatZero Reward

The success of application in consensus economy comes from the strong support of users. Whether the application is successful has a very important parameter: **Price.**

\*\*\*\*

**Witness highlight moment of price milestone !**

When price increases, all holders get huge gain. At the same time, if the price increases 10 times, that is, the price seems to be 'eaten a zero'. In order to witness the highlight moment of price milestone, EatZero Reward will be launched.

EatZero Reward rules is described as below:

The account of ownership will take out 5% of the shares from the LP pool, then delete liquidity to obtain ZGoat and BNB, of which ZGoat is sent to the blackhole burnt and BNB is distributed to holders. 80% of BNB is distributed according to Consensus Point ratio, and 20% of BNB is distributed according to Total Reward.

$$
Consensus Point = LP amout * LP holdtime, within  
 30day
$$

$$
Total Reward = Airdrop Reward + Invitation Reward
$$

* Current Price: $0.0000001
* Estimated Reward: 100 BNB
* Goal Price: $0.000001
