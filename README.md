## 一、Defi-Marketing Is A Blank Area

Crypto has experienced four stages of development: **2009-2013 Confused Era, 2013-2017 Crazy Era, 2017-2021 DeFi Era, 2021-? Entity Economy Application Era**

In confused era, crypto marketing is in small communication, with little effect. By the ICO Crazy in 2017, crypto marketing is through the crazy "ten thousand times" ROI,  then be cold due to the lack of application; With the popularization of Defi, the crypto marketing has been needed by various Defi Application,such as lending, DEX, Aggregation, Asset Data, Bridge-Chain, etc. However, the method of defi-marketing is just community with low efficiency.

All current Defi application designs are based on the idea of basic product, however the design based on the idea of marketing is completely blank. The product application  is full of varieties, but marketing application is completely blank. ZGoat will solve this problem and is the first Defi-marketing application with big business.

## 二、Make Defi-Marketing Easier

For any application of consensus economy, the larger the consensus, the greater the value. The popularity of Defi project has made the rapid development of cryptocurrency. However, it still faces many problems:

* The participation threshold for ordinary users is still high.
* The operation experience is also bad.
* Low frequency

Through entertainment, ZGoat makes the defi application be used more widely, and the using frequency higher, entertaining more, participation threshold lower.

![Little Girl, Meet Zuckerberg](.gitbook/assets/03.png)

Taking [WISH001](http://zgoat.org/#/Home) as example, the first wish launched by a little girl on ZGoat platform was related with Zuckerberg's Twitter about Bitcoin. As the founder of the world's largest social platform, Zuckerberg has huge followings. And the little girl is a common person in the world. the wish to link "Zuckerberg" with "little girl", has its own huge topic effect. On the other hand, user will be rewarded with ZGoat Token by supporting the wish, which is a further encourage for users to participate.

1. _**\[Entertainment\]**_ Help the little girl meet Zuckerberg;
2. _**\[Low threshold\]**_ Users only need copy to comment, and they will get the opportunity for rewards;
3. _**\[High frequency\]**_ Everyone can make a wish with different ideas, generating high-frequency applications;
4. _**\[Secondary marketing\]**_ Hot wishes can form secondary topic for marketing and ZGoat will gradually become the leading brand of defi-marketing;

As a result, any hot topic can be embedded in the wish list, such as "Wu Yifan event", that can be made a wish by someone, the theme such as "Kris Wu, ZhaNan". Another example, Zhengzhou Flood also can be made a wish, the theme such as "Zhengzhou Power".

ZGoat wishlist always combines the newest and hottest topic, with high user participation and low threshold. Different from other products, there are usually only two or three Marketing Event. ZGoat can combine hot topics all the time, with various scene.

## 三、Big Business

Different from other product design based on the idea of product application , ZGoat is an innovative leading product based on the idea of marketing application, with small closed-loop business model concept. ZGoat has a big business profit model. According to market data, for many products, they are extramely lacking of marketing topics when developing. The lack of marketing topics often leads to the accelerated profit decline, and even makes product fail.

### 1.The basic profitability is 315 times than Shib

![Closed Loop Business Model](.gitbook/assets/xiao-bi-huan-.png)

At the beginning of the design, ZGoat integrated the marketing concept into the small closed-loop design of the product, as shown in the above figure, which can be simply summarized into the following steps:

* Generate a wish based on the current hot topics, and provide ZGoat rewards for users;
* User participating is simplified and entertaining to ensure that ordinary users can also participate;
* Airdrop rewards users received need to unlock by staking ZGoat LP, increasing ZGoat price and generating handling fees;
* Part of handling fee is transferred to the Marketing Management Account to ensure that there are enough ZGoat to support airdrop marketing activities without interruption;
* Generate new hot topics and form a small closed loop, making ZGoat always be hottest;

According to Shib transaction data of feixiaohao.com, the 24h volume is $0.375 billion, with 2.22% price increase in the past 30 days. For the ZGoat, assuming the volume is only 20% of Shib.

|  | Shib | ZGoat |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 24h Valume | 375,000,000 | 75,000,000 |
| 30Day Price Change | 2.22% | 150% |
| Investment Cost | 1000 | 0 |
|  |  |  |
| **Profit** | **22.2** | **525,000,000** |

{% hint style="info" %}
Assuming that each user transfers $1,000 on average within 24h, the number of Shib participants is 375000, and the number of ZGoat participants is 1/5 of Shib, about 75000, then a month later, user investing Shib users will get a profit of $22.2. The profit of the ZGoat is calculated as: \(6% +1%\)  _\* 0.375 billion_  \* 20% \* _\(1+1/3\)_  \* 30 \*  \(1 + 150%\) = $0.525 billion, of which, 1% is the estimated proportion of holder reward of Marketing Management Account , and 150% is the estimated increase rate of currency price within 30 days according to a similar product model.
{% endhint %}

From the above model, ZGoat's basic profitability is hundreds of times than Shib. Even if all the profits are distributed to all users through AirDrop, each person invests $1,000 on average, then the number of participants is 75000. The average profit is $0.525 billion/75000 = $7000.**That is, the basic profitability of ZGoat is 7000/22.2=315 times than Shib.**

### 2.The core profit scene is like TikTok, in daily life

ZGoat aim is to help users say wishes out. Like TikTok, everyone has the need to show himself, and also has the need to support other's show or wish. When the number of ZGoat holders reaches a certain number, the platform will open WISHLIST function, for user-defined wish, including text, picture or even video form. Different from TikTok, the wish has a positive energy goal, which is against the feature of killing time.

According to long-tail theory, when product catches long-tail users, it will become a platform. Different from common DEFI application, usually only 1-2 core profit scene, ZGoat combines defi-marketing with entertainment to help users say wishes out, and others get reward by supporting wish. Different users have different wishes, that making ZGoat adopt various scene. At the same time, wish can be user-defined by  ordinary people to reduce the participation threshold of DEFI.

![\( ZGoat multi-scenario application \)](.gitbook/assets/pu-tong-xiang-mu-chang-jing-vs-zgoat-chang-jing-.png)

The process of wishlist is: Make A Wsh-&gt; ZGoat Support-&gt; User Participation-&gt; User Receiving ZGoat Rewards. In the whole process, the platform will get profit, such as Tx Fee during the period of staking ZGoat, 50% of unclaimed reward transferred to Marketing Management Account, Commission Fee, the currency price raising...

|  | Common  Project | ZGoat |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Scene Number | 2 | 10000 |
| Using Ratio | 100% | 20% |
| Tx Volume | 0.1 Billion\(DEX\) | 1000 |
| 30-day Volume | 6 Billion | 0.06 Billion |
| Tx Fee | 3000w | 840w |
| Unlock Profit | 0 | 1260w |
| Aridrop Unclaim | 0 | 1200w |
| Commission Fee | 1/3 | 20% |
|  |  |  |
| **Total Profit** | **1000w** | **4500w** |

{% hint style="info" %}
Assume that using ratio of ZGoat is 1/5 of common projects, and ZGoat staking for each wish is valued $1,000 \(refer to TikTok\), then the volume of the 30-day wishlist  is: 10000/5_\*_30_\*_1000 = $60 million. Profit: \(6% +1%\) _\* 0.06 billion \*_  2 \* _\(1+150%\)+0.06 billion_  \* 20% +0.06 billion \* 20% = $45 million, of which, 1% is the estimated proportion of holder reward of Marketing Management Account , and 150% is the estimated increase rate of currency price within 30 days according to a similar product model.Proportion of  unclaim is assumed to be 20%, and proportion of commission fee is 20%.
{% endhint %}

Since the cost of this part is zero, thus this profit can be used for raising currency price or other marketing activities, forming a positive loop. On the other hand, with the increase of holders, the application scene will also increase, and the profits of this part will also rise, with big imagination.



### 3.Magic profit model: ROI = 120,000

![\( To Be Referrer will be rewarded \)](.gitbook/assets/yao-qing-fan-yong-.png)

In previous DEFI projects, early participants will gain a strong enough price advantage, which seems not very fair. Who brings the real users should enjoy the highest percentage of handling fees and dividends. ZGoat's commission invitation mechanism well meets this demand:

> 1. The mechanism is written into the decentralized contract, without human intervention, and is fair and just;
> 2. No matter early participants or late participants, the commission mechanism is in the same standard and has no first-mover advantage.
> 3. In the past, the encrypted money industry could only make money by rising the price of tokens or short contracts. ZGoat's commission invitation mechanism may have created a brand-new profit model. Due to the large proportion of commission, it is tentatively set to 60% of the share of cash holding. If high-quality trading users can be invited, the profit will be very objective.

|  | Address A |
| :--- | :--- |
| Input cost | 1000w ZGoat |
| Input cost value | $1 |
| Commission rate | 60% |
| Address B trading platform | Pancakeswap |
| Address B monthly transaction volume = 0 | -$1 |
| Address B monthly transaction volume = USD 1,000 | $12 |
| Address B monthly transcation volume = USD 100,000 | $1200 |
| Address B monthly transcation volume = USD 10 million | $12w |
|  |  |
| **Return on Investment** | **Up to 120,000 times** |

{% hint style="info" %}
According to the Commission invitation rules, if Address A is the first to donate more than or equal to 1000 thousand zgoats to address B, address A will become the recommender of address B forever. In the future, 1.2% or 0.6%de will be charged to address A for each transaction of address B. At the current currency price, the approximate cost of 1000 million zgoats is USD 1. If address B is a large account, the transaction volume in 30 days is USD 1000 million, then the Commission for the handling fee of address A is USD 12,000 or USD 6,000,**It is equivalent to a monthly return on investment of 120,000 times**. For ordinary users, the 30-day transaction volume is USD 10,000, and the Commission for handling fees is about USD 120 or USD 60,**Equivalent to a monthly return on investment of 120 times**. At the same time, address A can invite and donate to multiple users. If the invited users produce considerable transactions, the return on investment of address A will be A large amount of digital income.

Of course, if the user invited by address A does not generate A transaction, address A will lose USD 1.

### 4.Future profit model: empower more real economy

The development of encrypted currency from chaos era to financial product era is still limited to the field of encrypted currency, and it is difficult to make a breakthrough in expanding the application of encrypted currency. The emergence of ZGoat may solve the current dilemma of encrypted currency. In terms of ecological layout, ZGoat will gradually empower the real economy and win-win for a long time.

At the beginning of the product design, ZGoat focused on "Marketing and Entertainment + zero handling fee exchange + entertainment consumption + e-commerce platform", aiming at a long-term win-win situation and devoting itself to empowering the real economy. The total amount of ZGoat issued was 210,000 billion, and the initial burning was 110,000 billion. For the first time, the decentralized Commission invitation system was adopted, and it was written into the intelligent contract. The Commission ratio was 60% of the bonus of the holder, when burning to the remaining amount of 2100 billion, stop burning and update the transaction handling fee ratio.

As more real economies are empowered in the future, the profit model will be more objective.
