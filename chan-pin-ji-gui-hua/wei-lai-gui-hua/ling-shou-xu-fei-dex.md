# Free handling fee DEX

The main profit model of current exchanges, including CEX and DEX, is charging handling fees. According to the development experience of the Internet, the Internet has experienced three major stages:

1. Paid Internet: It mainly focuses on early Internet products, such as charged anti-virus software.
2. Free Internet: mainly based on mid-term Internet products, such as Taobao free merchants
3. Pay-back Internet: mainly Internet products in the middle and late stages, such as Didi Taxi subsidy

For exchanges in the encrypted currency industry, they will gradually go through these three stages.

1. Paid exchange
2. Free Exchange
3. Reverse money exchange

The business model of zero handling charge will be a dimensionality reduction blow of the existing exchange model and become a new strong competitor of the exchange track.[
