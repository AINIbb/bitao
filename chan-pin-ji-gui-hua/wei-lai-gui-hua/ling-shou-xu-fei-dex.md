The main profit model of current exchanges, including CEX and DEX, is charging transation fees. According to the experience of Internet technology development, three major stages have experienced :

1. Paid Internet: mainly focuses on early Internet products, such as charged anti-virus software.
2. Free Internet: mainly focuses on mid-term Internet products, such as E-commerce platform for free.
3. Subsidy Internet: mainly focuses on in the mid-and-late term Internet products, such as Didi Taxi.

For exchanges in cryptocurrency, it will also go through that three stages.

1. Paid Exchange

3. Subsidy Exchange

The business model of zero fee excharge will be a dimensional strike for existing exchange, and will become a new strong competitor of the exchange.[
