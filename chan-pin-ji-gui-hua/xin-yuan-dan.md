# Wishlist

Wishlist is the entry point of ZGoat's product, where any user or project party can participate or initiate a wish. The main pain point of Wish List is marketing and entertainment in the crypto industry, lowering the threshold for ordinary users to participate while increasing the frequency of participation. Users can exercise their own creativity by customizing the wish pattern.
