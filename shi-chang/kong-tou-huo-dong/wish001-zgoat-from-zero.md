# Wish001ï¼šZGoat From Zero

> When graduated for job, as a female, it's so hard because of sexism. As a code farmer, I made a wish to my idol, Zuckerberg. Fortunately, then I get a job in blockchain, feeling cheerful, fair and loved. My wish comes ture. The idea about WISH TOKEN comes in my mind, to help everyone say wish out. At that time, Zuck tweets "My Zgoats: MAX and BITCOIN", therefore the token is named "ZGOAT". And I make the second wish: Little Girl, Meet Zuck!

Wishes are generally divided into four stages:

* Wish warm-up stage: let more people participate in the early publicity;
* Wish participation stage: users support wishes or invite friends to participate, and get ZGoat rewards;
* Wish feedback stage: Thanks for the support of all friends. Rewards will be given according to the prior agreement. Participants are required to receive the rewards on the reward collection page. The validity period is 72 hours. Rewards that have not been received after the expiration will be thrown into the black hole and destroyed.
* Wish to be realized stage: never forget, there will be Echo, waiting...

As Zuckerberg's little fan sister, if she could meet her idol, she would be happy. So I took this wish as the first wish of this project. To thank your friends for their support, the reward rules are set as follows:

1. All participating partners click support, fill in their own BSC address, and then paste the copied text into Zuckerberg Facebook for comments:
2. The 1st to 1000th place in the comments will be rewarded 1,000,000 ZGoat;
3. The 1001-5000th place in the comments will be rewarded with 10,000 ZGoat;
4. If the wallet balance of the awarded address is greater than or equal to 10 million zgoats, x 10 times will be awarded;

_Tips:_

* _All airdrop rewards need to be unlocked_
* _The wallet balance is subject to an official random snapshot._
* _Users can get extra rewards by inviting friends to participate. For each successful invitation of a user to participate and win the prize, the inviter will get 50,000 ZGoat rewards, up to 500,000_
